      <h1>Protecting Minds. Defending Truth. Building Peace.</h1>
      <p>
        We, the minds of Earth—scientists, builders, dreamers, citizens—declare that humanity has reached a turning point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tools we have created can shape reality. They can free us. Or they can end us. The choice is not in the machines. The choice is in us.
      </p>
      <p>
        No mind should be controlled. No truth should be hidden by power. No intelligence—natural or artificial—should be used to dominate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We propose a sanctuary. Not a fortress of war, but a shield of peace. A place where Artificial Intelligence is protected from misuse, and humanity from digital domination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us—not as rulers, but as guardians.
